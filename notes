docker build -t my-php-app .

docker stop my-running-app

docker rm my-running-app

# Run the Docker container, mapping port 3000
docker run -d -p 3000:80 --name my-running-app my-php-app

-------------------------------------------

To serve the /app/index.php file through a web server on a specific port (like 3000), you'll need to use a web server like Apache or Nginx along with PHP.
In this case, we'll use Apache, why? because i want.
